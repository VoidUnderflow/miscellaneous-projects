### Movements
`h, j` = Left, Down
`k, l` = Up, Right

`l` = Right is already pretty illegal imo

`w` = go to beginning of next word
`e` = go to end of next word

`b` = go to the beginning of prev word
`B` = go to the beginning of the prev WORD (space delimiters(?))

### Actions
`x` = delete char on cursor
`2x` = delete next two char on cursor
