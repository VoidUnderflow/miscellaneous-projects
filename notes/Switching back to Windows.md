### Why
- New kernel makes games unplayable, constant screen tears, crashes, etc. + random screen freezes when doing normal things.
- Tried to get help: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-hwe-6.14/+bug/2127215, was recommended to update laptop's firmware.
- Can only update laptop's firmware on Windows, `fwupd` is finding no available updates (after I made it work).
- Want my Steam games to work.
